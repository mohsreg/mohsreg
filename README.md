# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am really real homosapien, human being, real person, etc.; who masquerades as a TV-headed VTuber on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/mohsregTV) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@mohsregTV). I really don't know much of anything, let alone coding, and so here lies my GitHub account, which houses some, if not all of my personal project, many of which will never see the light of day and remain private repos. Oh, I also have a [Website](https://mohsreg.github.io).

**mohsreg/mohsreg** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on my GitHub profile.

-   ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: `mohsregTV VTuber Avatar v2`
-   ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: `to survive`
-   ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: `Playing Games on Stream`
-   ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: `Free Discord bot hosting without sacrificing my soul and personal info`
-   ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: `Anything? I don't know everything, I only know what I know`
-   ðŸ“« How to reach me: `Socials are on my Website above!`
-   ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: `They/Them`
-   âš¡ Bio: `I am the Illest TV Screen`
